LabsLand is a global network where multiple universities and individuals participate in improving the laboratories. Here we want to provide 
acknowledge to everyone who has contributed to this laboratory to exist as it is today:

•	Dr. Cándido Aramburu (UPNA): UPNA deployed the first Intel FPGA laboratories, deploying 10 of them in June 2019. Candido designed UPNA 
  deployment, which was extremely used during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Candido also participated in all the creation of the 
  first design, including the integration of Quartus in the environment and first ARM prototypes for the DE1-SoC boards.
•	Dr. Rania Hussein (University of Washington): Dr. Hussein at the University of Washington supported this laboratory in various ways:
  co-sponsored key features such as the breadboard support, the audio and video input support and the virtual keyboard and virtual joystick.
  Additionally, Dr. Hussein made many suggestions, such as the inclusion of SystemVerilog. Also, University of Washington is one of the 
  FPGA providers, with 8 DE1-SoC boards.
•	Dr. Narayanan Ramakrishnan (Monash Malaysia): Dr. Ramakrishnan at Monash Malaysia co-sponsored the support for Nios II in the DE2-115 boards. 
  Additionally, Monash Malaysia was one of the power users of the first half of 2020, with over 15,000 laboratory sessions by Dr. Ramakrishnan's students!
•	Dr. Matt Smith and Dr. Donald C. Winsor (University of Michigan): University of Michigan is providing 12 DE2-115 boards, using Dr. Smith and
  Dr. Winsor's design by themselves; and it is actively used at the University of Michigan. They also supported the virtual N8 controller.
•	Ana Lucia Beraldo (UNIFESP): UNIFESP was the first (together with UPNA) provider of the Intel FPGA laboratories, and not only deployed its own 
  FPGA boards, but also contributed many ideas on how the system should work. UNIFESP uses actively this laboratory
•	Dr. Javier García-Zubia, Dr. Ignacio Angulo, Dr. Unai Hernández (University of Deusto): All this work has been based on the 15+ years of Research 
  and Development by the WebLab-Deusto research group, led by Dr. García-Zubia. LabsLand is a spin-off of this research group.
